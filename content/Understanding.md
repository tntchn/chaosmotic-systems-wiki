#### Lecture III of Section I in Alfred North Whitehead's book [[Modes of Thought]]

Notes:
Understanding is based upon 'self-evidence,' self-evidence being the characteristic of something 'explaining itself'. 
Point 3: "Proof" = based on abstraction
- 48 - Philosophy: proof should be at minimum, as self-evidence is where it works. You do not prove something, you make it known how it is self evident, which then leads to understanding. Philosophy "cannot be proved"
Point 4: "Disorder, Evil, Error"
- 51 The Many vs The One
	- unity requires multiplicity, which requires unity
	- Patterns
	- the finite depends on exclusion of others, cutting out those comparable
Point 5: Process = change + permanence (they require each other)
- 'and' vs 'together'
	- inconsistency and process
		- inconsistency - two things brought together which cannot be brought together. 'not being is a type of being'
		- 54 - "P and Q" how the universe escapes from the exclusions of inconsistency
			- the 'finitude of circumstance'
- The universe is infinite and unconfined (55), can never be understood, only abstracted or 'proved'
Point 6: Specialization and Systematization of Knowledge
- 'narrowing blocks process'
- patterns and progress
Point 7: Understanding has 2 modes of advance - gathering of detail within an assigned pattern, and discovery of novel pattern/novel detail (58)
- Progress/advance/penetration -> is lost -> completed knowledge (certainty) (58)
- Composition is based on inconsistency, on excluding.
- There are two types of inconsistency
	- logical - difference between different things, alternative factors in a composition
	- aesthetic - details and the whole
	- The degree of abstraction in logical is high, whereas aesthetic is low
- enjoyment and creation - of abstract details permitting the abstract unity
