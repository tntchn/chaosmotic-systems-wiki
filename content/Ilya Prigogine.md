Viscount Ilya Romanovich Prigogine (1917–2003), a Belgian physical chemist of Russian-Jewish origin, is renowned for his groundbreaking work on dissipative structures and their role in thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, a contribution that earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.

Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures offers a framework for understanding how order and complexity can emerge in systems driven by external energy flows. He further elaborated on this concept in the seminal book *[[Order Out of Chaos]]*, co-authored with [[Isabelle Stengers]], which explores the philosophical and scientific implications of self-organization and dynamic processes in nature, critiquing classical science.

> "In Prigoginian terms, all systems contain subsystems, which are continually 'fluctuating.' At times, a single fluctua­ tion or a combination of them may become so powerful, as a result of positive feedback, that it shatters the preexisting or­ ganization. At this revolutionary moment-the authors call it a 'singular moment' or a 'bifurcation point'-it is inherently impossible to determine in advance which direction change will take: whether the system will disintegrate into "chaos" or leap to a new, more differentiated , higher level of 'order' or organization, which they call a 'dissipative structure.' (Such physical or chemical structures are termed dissipative be­cause, compared with the simpler structures they replace , they require more energy to sustain them.)" XV
