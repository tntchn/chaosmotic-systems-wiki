#### Lecture IV of Section II in Alfred North Whitehead's book [[Modes of Thought]]

Notes<br>
The technology of writing progressed gradually over time, but the strongest division was when it began being used as a means of writing "intimate thoughts" (66)
- an abstraction from environment

###### Point 2: Each entity has its own perspective of the world
- Fact relies on the current perspective, and the 'elimination of alternatives'
- eternal objects & muddiness
- actual occasions
###### Point 3: "Absolutes"
- "Extreme" type of being -> God? Zero?
- "Realm of 'completely real'" (68) -> "absolutes"
- "In the house of forms, there are many mansions" (69)
- There is no "absolute reality," everything refers to something externally & referentially.
- The "unreal" (69)
- "Extremes of Existence" - Actuality & Potentiality in a reciprocal relationship. Actuality is the exemplification of Potentiality, which is the characterization of actuality. 
- Evidence of philosophy comes from the shared (uniquely) human experience (70)
###### Point 4: What is Character?
- Enjoyment (71)
- (Intimate) Experience and the body are entangled. (The way seeing a sunrise makes you feel)
- Complexity, vagueness, and compulsive intensity.
###### Point 5: Sense perception - How we discern the external world (72)
- Clarity, distinctness, indifference.
	- form, color, quality
- Definition of "Nature" (73)
- We (humans) are characters of higher animal experience.
- Approximate accuracy, qualitative assignment, essential omission.
- Science is the omission of irrelevant modes of existence.
###### Point 6: Start Vague!
- The 3 principles of division, in 3 pairs of opposites (75)
- Goodness and Order and Mathematics (76)
	- Goodness requires "badness," you can't have a good time if you cant count!
	- differentiate forms (78)
###### Point 7: Infinitude
- There cannot truly be an "infinite," all things must be 'this' and not 'that'.
- "Exclusion means finitude"
- Clarity + Order must go along with vagueness + disorder, or we become definite and it sucks. (79)
- Referring back to Part I, averages and uniformity is a characteristic of non-life. life comes from ambiguity + flux. 
- How can the afterlife be so great if its unchanging and infinite? "Eternal life" an oxymoron?
- Math + definite / perfect forms are a "glimpse of eternity" (81)
###### Point 8: Separation from Creativity
- The process has been lost. (81)
- "Changeless world of ultimate reality" -> derived into (our) historic world of change
- Knowledge is action! not perfection!
- "vitiated to ruin" (82)
- Static systems of math vs life + motion + reality (82)
###### Point 9: We are embodied in process
- Infinitude and finitude require each other (83)
- Existence requires a past/present/future
- Triviality mentioned on page 84
