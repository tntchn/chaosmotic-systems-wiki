The brutality of the flash agents of Communication. Changes, violent changes are happening all the time. Glissant argues that contemporary violence and the response from societies are exacerbated by “the flash agents of Communication.”

 >In a note by the translator the meaning of flash agents depends on the context. It tries to describe the instantaneous relay of information by mass media, the mass media presenting a hegemonic perspective. 
    
Flash agents have some control of the spread of information, and thus control the spread of chaos, benefitting from it.  

The idea of identity as “root” is quickly falling from favor, while there are of course a vast amount of people still rooted to their identity. Glissant posits that the “speeding up of relationships has repercussions on how the full-sense of identity is understood.” Therefore through speeding up mass communication, i.e the internet identity drastically shifts from a fixed point to a variable. The old root idea leads to a generalization, a stick in the mud. People confronted with this change inevitably reject it, thus suppressing their own web of difference and complexity.  

When identity is determined by a root, the subject is captured, the emigrant is condemned. 
The following is Glissant’s distinctions between Root and Relation identities.

Root identity

-is founded in the distant past in a vision, a myth of the creation of the world;

-is sanctified by the hidden violence of a filiation that strictly follows from this founding episode;

-is ratified by a claim to legitimacy that allows a community to proclaim its entitlement to the possession of a land, which thus becomes a territory;

- is preserved by being projected onto other territories, making their conquest legitimate-and through the project of a discursive knowledge.

Root identity therefore rooted the thought of self and of

territory and set in motion the thought of the other and of voyage.

Relation identity

-is linked not to a creation of the world but to the conscious and contradictory experience of contacts among cultures;

- is produced in the chaotic network of Relation and not in the hidden violence of filiation;

-does not devise any legitimacy as its guarantee of entitlement, but circulates, newly extended;

-does not think of a land as a territory from which to project toward other territories but as a place where one gives-on-and-with rather than grasps. 

Relation identity exults the thought of errantry and of totality.

Glissant goes on to note three rallying points part of a non atavistic society:

- Relationship with natural surroundings
    
- Defense of the people’s language
    
- Protection of the land
