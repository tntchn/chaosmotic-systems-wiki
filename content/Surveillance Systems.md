MIT tech review Operation Safety Net  Feedback looping the faces of our Friends, the all surrounding pessimism dripping from the cornices and corbel's of the metropolis' walls

An investigation conducted by MIT Technology Review shows that Operation Safety Net (OSN) continued its work far past and beyond the scope of its original stated mission. Doug Neville, spokesperson for OSN writes that it is "not an ongoing operation". However, MIT Tech Review has evidence to the contrary. A photo of a department meeting, with a slide projected on a screen with the heading "OSN 2.0". 

This is, as MIT Tech Review puts it, OSN is "a complex engine of surveillance tailor-made for keeping close tabs on protestors". A wide system of surveillance that spans the FBI, Minneapolis Police Department, and other local and federal agencies. OSN funneled collected information into a subscription based app thanks to AT&T. "It's much like Slack for SWAT", Scroll through lengthy lists of protestors and journalists, see if you find anyone remotely resembling them. Watch drone footage taken during the uprising. 

>"Taken together, they reveal how advanced surveillance techniques and technologies employed by the state, sometimes in an extra-legal fashion, have changed the nature of protest in the United States, effectively bringing an end to Americansâ€™ ability to exercise their First Amendment rights anonymously in public spaces"

The iPhone introduced a new feature in recent years, geo-tagged photos. Where a user can look at Apple maps and pins will be dropped wherever you have taken a photo before. While this could be useful in locating a specific photo you took in that one place that one time; the implications and paranoid realities that become possible are bewildering. 

We as an American culture, at least within my reaches, prefer not to look into the maw of the blackhole-camera and wave it away. We're all too busy to care, too depressed to fight, too anxious to look, and privileged enough to not be affected by it.  Too often you hear a podcaster, influencer, whoever, say: 'I fully submit, fuck it, they already have my face, finger prints, eye-color, and a map of my tattoos, what do I have to care.' We tell ourselves anything to make us feel better, it's part of survival. 

other third party owned indoor security cameras offer a contradictory sense of security for middle and upper class households. We know now too well how vulnerable these cameras are to exploitation by anyone with an adequate amount of computer knowledge. Inescam.com a surface website where you can access security cameras all around the world, a couple in chicago, one where we see the dark corner of some establishment with six gambling machines. In the deep-web, you can find sites where a few individuals compile hundreds if not thousands of personal computer web-cams. Free quick and easy access to the assumed most private place a person can be. 

Spectacularization has become incredibly ingrained within the newer generations minds. We see largely attended protests, where a brave soul struck with inspiration ends up being handcuffed. The last thing the crowd will do is take the leap, de-arrest, and help our fellow Friend not be needlessly carried off. Our first instinct as [[the observer]]s, to chant "The whole world is watching!", showing how we already pre-conceive ourselves as images. This is following the argument Ian Allan Paul lays out in the Ill Will article *Liberal Infernos* "the desire to be recognized usurps the desire to revolt". Debord would truly have a fit if he saw the state of our protests today.

Shards of reality assemble themselves into an [[autopoiesis]], a nucleus divorced from the reality in the streets. This ontogenetic world presents itself in the form of nothing but images. In other words, the multiple feeds endlessly running and feeding back into itself becomes the de facto reality the majority of the population see. Within an atomised society of 

Living in one of the biggest cities in the world such as chicago, one must reckon with the fact that you will be documented by a security camera, if not by a pesky anachronistic "documenter street" photographer. One foot out the door and there is a red wireframe surrounding your head. One foot toward the door of your neighbor and Amazon smiles while noting your facial expression skin color and how fast you are moving. Not to mention whatever utterance may happen to escape your trap. 

There's a three eyed face, the two of the subject, and the one of the camera. There's fluid group dynamics, individuals who spark an idea suddenly gains the inspiration to break, as if in a magnetic current others join. Curiosity, creativity, and potentials. In a highly prepared, organized manner, the room for improvisation is vast. The trouble is that it isn't so simple to be highly prepared and organized at the individual level. We are seeing now that even finding 3-4 other trusted friends is a tough task. We are being watched at every moment. For an increasing amount of the population, even in their homes.
