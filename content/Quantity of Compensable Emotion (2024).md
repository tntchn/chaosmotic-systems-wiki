*Quantity of Compensable Emotion* is a sound installation utilizing electronic circuitry with an infrared sensor triggering two outputs: a speaker playback and a numerical display. The sensor activates a recording of the Taiwanese swear word 「幹你娘」 ("motherf-ker") and increments a display by $2,666 USD, the highest fine ever imposed for using the phrase under [Taiwan’s Civil Code Article 195](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawSearchContent.aspx?pcode=B0000001&norge=195). This work examines the commodification of emotion and language within legal systems, seeking to illuminate the interplay and excess between social expression, ethical value, and institutional frameworks.
