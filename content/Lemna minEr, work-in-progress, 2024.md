plant, heavy metal, ceramic test tiles

_Lemna minEr_ is an environmental art project that utilizes the bioaccumulation capabilities of common duckweed (_Lemna minor_) to address water contamination by heavy metals, specifically Chromium Oxide and Copper Sulfate. These metals are absorbed by the plant and then used in the creation of ceramic test tiles, with the metals serving as underglaze. The resulting tiles visually represent heavy metal contaminants bioaccumulated by the plant, with gradients indicating the severity of contamination, demonstrating both the proof of principle for bioremediation and its potential use in identifying polluted water bodies.

The project explores the biological properties of _Lemna minor_, a floating aquatic plant from the Lemnaceae family, known for its ability to absorb and store heavy metals through processes like phytoextraction and phytostabilization. [Scientific studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30784736/) have confirmed duckweed’s significant potential for bioremediation, making it an ideal subject for this environmental intervention.

In addition to its biological focus, _Lemna minEr_ aims to raise awareness about the global water crisis. Drawing from the [United Nations' 2023 World Water Development Report](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384657), the project underscores the urgent need for action, highlighting that 10% of the global population lives in areas experiencing high or critical water stress, and nearly 2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to rising levels of heavy metals in the environment, and this project seeks to address that challenge by promoting both environmental consciousness and practical solutions for water contamination.

(*Lemna minEr* was initially conceived as a group project during the Spring of 2024 and has since been carried forward by Daniel to further explore and expand its potential for both artistic and activist impact.)

Drawing inspiration from the November 20th, 1988 episode of _The Equinox_, which explores the chaotic rotation of Saturn’s moon Hyperion, I was fascinated by how Hyperion can appear both orderly and chaotic. This duality—where Saturn’s gravitational pull maintains Hyperion’s orbit despite its irregular rotation—motivated me to take the _Lemna minEr_ project in a new direction. I’ve begun culturing _Lemna minor_ in iron oxide, aiming to transform the plant into a permanent magnet. My goal is to create an installation where this magnetized plant interacts with an electronic circuit featuring a motion sensor that activates an electromagnet. Much like Saturn’s influence on Hyperion, the electromagnet will pull the plant in various ways, altering its movement. The chaos arises from the third oscillation of human interaction: the electromagnet is only activated when the motion sensor detects a presence, introducing an unpredictable, chaotic element to the plant's behavior, alluding to the erratic orbit of Hyperion.
