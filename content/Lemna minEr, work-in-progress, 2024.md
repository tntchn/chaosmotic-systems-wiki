plant, heavy metal, ceramic test tiles

==Phase 1==

_Lemna minEr_ is an environmental art project that utilizes the bioaccumulation capabilities of common duckweed (_Lemna minor_) to address water contamination by heavy metals, specifically Chromium Oxide and Copper Sulfate. These metals are absorbed by the plant and then used in the creation of ceramic test tiles, with the metals serving as underglaze. The resulting tiles visually represent heavy metal contaminants bioaccumulated by the plant, with gradients indicating the severity of contamination, demonstrating both the proof of principle for bioremediation and its potential use in identifying polluted water bodies.

The project explores the biological properties of _Lemna minor_, a floating aquatic plant from the Lemnaceae family, known for its ability to absorb and store heavy metals through processes like phytoextraction and phytostabilization. [Scientific studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30784736/) have confirmed duckweed’s significant potential for bioremediation, making it an ideal subject for this environmental intervention.

In addition to its biological focus, _Lemna minEr_ aims to raise awareness about the global water crisis. Drawing from the [United Nations' 2023 World Water Development Report](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384657), the project underscores the urgent need for action, highlighting that 10% of the global population lives in areas experiencing high or critical water stress, and nearly 2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to rising levels of heavy metals in the environment, and this project seeks to address that challenge by promoting environmental consciousness.

While the project aims to provide a practical solution for addressing water contamination, the group has acknowledged the limitations of the methodology, for instance, the presence of other heavy metals in the solution can drastically affect the color on the test tiles, making the identification of contamination in water bodies inconsistent.

==Phase 2==

Drawing inspiration from the [November 20th, 1988, *Chaos* episode of _The Equinox_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvTKBYBMFY), which explores the chaotic rotation of Saturn’s moon Hyperion, I was fascinated by how Hyperion can appear both orderly and chaotic. This duality—where Saturn’s gravitational pull maintains Hyperion’s orbit despite its irregular rotation—motivated me to take the _Lemna minEr_ project in a new direction. 

I’ve begun culturing _Lemna minor_ in iron oxide, aiming to transform the plant into a permanent magnet. My goal is to create an installation where this magnetized plant interacts with an electronic circuit featuring a motion sensor that activates an electromagnet. Much like Saturn’s influence on Hyperion, the electromagnet will pull the plant in various ways, altering its movement. The chaos arises from the third oscillation of human interaction: the electromagnet is only activated when the motion sensor detects a presence, introducing an unpredictable, chaotic element to the plant's behavior, alluding to the erratic orbit of Hyperion.

*Lemna minor* demonstrates significant bioaccumulation of iron-oxide within just 48 hours of culturing in an iron-oxide solution. However, while the plant accumulates iron, it does not become a permanent magnet, but rather a passive magnet. This is because the iron compounds in the plant’s cells are not magnetized unless exposed to a sufficiently strong magnetic field. While the plant stores the iron-oxide in its cells, the fluid-filled nature of the plant's living cells prevents the iron compounds from being fixed in place, meaning the cells cannot be magnetized permanently.
