plant, heavy metal, ceramic test tiles

#### Phase 1: Chromium, Copper, Magnesium

_Lemna minEr_ is an environmental art project that utilizes the bioaccumulation capabilities of common duckweed (_Lemna minor_) to address water contamination by heavy metals, specifically Chromium Oxide and Copper Sulfate. These metals are absorbed by the plant and then used in the creation of ceramic test tiles, with the metals serving as underglaze. The resulting tiles visually represent heavy metal contaminants bioaccumulated by the plant, with gradients indicating the severity of contamination, demonstrating both the proof of principle for bioremediation and its potential use in identifying polluted water bodies.

The project explores the biological properties of _Lemna minor_, a floating aquatic plant from the Lemnaceae family, known for its ability to absorb and store heavy metals through processes like phytoextraction and phytostabilization. [Scientific studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30784736/) have confirmed duckweed’s significant potential for bioremediation, making it an ideal subject for this environmental intervention.

In addition to its biological focus, _Lemna minEr_ aims to raise awareness about the global water crisis. Drawing from the [United Nations' 2023 World Water Development Report](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384657), the project underscores the urgent need for action, highlighting that 10% of the global population lives in areas experiencing high or critical water stress, and nearly 2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to rising levels of heavy metals in the environment, and this project seeks to address that challenge by promoting environmental consciousness.

While the project aims to provide a practical solution for addressing water contamination, the group has acknowledged the limitations of the methodology, for instance, the presence of other heavy metals in the solution can drastically affect the color on the test tiles, making the identification of contamination in water bodies inconsistent.

#### Phase 2: Iron
(*Lemna minEr* was initially conceived as a group project during the Spring of 2024 and has since been carried forward by Daniel in the following semester of Fall.)

Drawing inspiration from the [November 20th, 1988, *Chaos* episode of _The Equinox_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BvTKBYBMFY), which explores the chaotic rotation of Saturn’s moon Hyperion, I was fascinated by how Hyperion can appear both orderly and chaotic. This duality—where Saturn’s gravitational pull maintains Hyperion’s orbit despite its irregular rotation—motivated me to take the _Lemna minEr_ project in a new direction. 

I’ve begun culturing _Lemna minor_ in iron oxide, aiming to transform the plant into a permanent magnet. My goal is to create an installation where this magnetized plant interacts with an electronic circuit featuring a motion sensor that activates an electromagnet. Much like Saturn’s influence on Hyperion, the electromagnet will pull the plant in various ways, altering its movement. The chaos arises from the third oscillation of human interaction: the electromagnet is only activated when the motion sensor detects a presence, introducing an unpredictable, chaotic element to the plant's behavior, alluding to the erratic orbit of Hyperion.

*Lemna minor* demonstrates significant bioaccumulation of iron-oxide within just 48 hours of culturing in an iron-oxide solution. However, while the plant accumulates iron, it does not become a permanent magnet, but rather a passive magnet. This is because the iron compounds in the plant’s cells are not magnetized unless exposed to a sufficiently strong magnetic field. While the plant stores the iron-oxide in its cells, the fluid-filled nature of the plant's living cells prevents the iron compounds from being fixed in place, meaning the cells cannot be magnetized permanently. (For more information on the science of magnetizing cells, see [PMC4310825](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4310825/).)

#### New Directions

The inability to transform the _Lemna minor_ plant into a permanent magnet has redirected the project into two new avenues of exploration.

1. Bioremediation Dynamics & Electromagnetic Sensing

One potential direction is to delve deeper into the dynamics of bioremediation through iron-oxide processes. This includes utilizing electromagnetic sensors to detect weak signals emitted during the bioremediation process.

2. Addressing Water Pollution in Taiwan

Another path is to focus on the water pollution challenges in Taiwan, exacerbated by the rapid development of the semiconductor industry. Heavy metals such as [hexavalent chromium, arsenic, lead](https://www.newsmarket.com.tw/blog/112442/), and [nickel](https://udn.com/news/story/7324/8028425), are major pollutants associated with this industry. Studies suggest that while _Lemna minor_ is capable of bioremediating some of these heavy metals, others accumulate in the silt and sediment of river bodies. This raises significant health concerns, especially given the proximity of these polluted sites to drinking water intake infrastructure. Incorporating bioremediation into this context could highlight its potential as a solution while addressing broader environmental and public health challenges.

#### Philosophical Framework

As discussed in _[[Order Out of Chaos]]_, Alexandre Koyré defines the innovation of modern science in terms of "experimentation." He states:

> "Modern science is based on the discovery of a new and specific form of communication with nature—that is, on the conviction that nature responds to experimental interrogation. How can we define more precisely the experimental dialogue? Experimentation does not mean merely the faithful observation of facts as they occur, nor the mere search for empirical connections between phenomena, but presupposes a systematic interaction between theoretical concepts and observation" ([[Ilya Prigogine]] and [[Isabelle Stengers]] 5).

This perspective inspires the project to embrace a systematic dialogue between theoretical frameworks and practical observation. By maintaining a spirit rooted in chaos theory, the *Lemna minEr* project merge scientific exploration with artistic critique, fostering a hybrid form of experimentation.

**Chaos Theory & The Arrow of Time**

Grounded in the principles of chaos theory, the project embraces the inherent unpredictability and interconnectedness of systems. Furthermore, it aligns with the concept of time’s irreversibility, a foundational idea in thermodynamics. As _[[Order Out of Chaos]]_ notes:

> “As for thermodynamics, it is based on the distinction of two types of processes: reversible processes, which are independent of the direction of time, and irreversible processes, which depend on the direction of time" (Prigogine and Stengers 12).

This philosophical underpinning not only informs the scientific methodologies employed but also guides the narrative arc of the project. It emphasizes the irreversible and evolving nature of ecological and cultural systems, instilling a sense of urgency, purpose, and drive toward meaningful action.

**Conclusion**

By situating _Lemna minor_ within the dual contexts of bioremediation dynamics and Taiwan’s water pollution crisis, the project seeks to bridge art and science—utilizing science as a logistical foundation and art as a medium for outreach and awareness. This interdisciplinary approach critically examines the pedagogical framework of scientific methodologies, questioning how these parameters are established and interpreted in dialogue.

Through the integration of science and art, the project aspires to craft alternative narratives and experimental frameworks that enrich our understanding of environmental sustainability.
