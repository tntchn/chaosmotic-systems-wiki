plant, heavy metal, ceramic test tiles

_Lemna minEr_ is an environmental art project that utilizes the bioaccumulation capabilities of common duckweed (_Lemna minor_) to address water contamination by heavy metals, specifically Chromium Oxide and Copper Sulfate. These metals are absorbed by the plant and then used in the creation of ceramic test tiles, with the metals serving as underglaze. The resulting tiles visually represent the potential danger of water contamination, turning bioaccumulated metals into a material metaphor for environmental threats.

The project explores the biological properties of _Lemna minor_, a floating aquatic plant from the Lemnaceae family, known for its ability to absorb and store heavy metals through processes like phytoextraction and phytostabilization. Scientific studies have confirmed duckweedâ€™s significant potential for bioremediation, making it an ideal subject for this environmental intervention.

In addition to its biological focus, _Lemna minEr_ aims to raise awareness about the global water crisis. Drawing from the United Nations' 2023 World Water Development Report%% [1](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384657) %%, the project underscores the urgent need for action, highlighting that 10% of the global population lives in areas experiencing high or critical water stress, and nearly 2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Anthropogenic activities contribute significantly to rising levels of heavy metals in the environment, and this project seeks to address that challenge by promoting both environmental consciousness and practical solutions for water contamination.

(*Lemna minEr* was initially conceived as a group project during the Spring of 2024 and has since been carried forward by Daniel to further explore and expand its potential for both artistic and activist impact.)
