Chaosmotic Systems: Culture, Cosmology, Computation is an MFA-level seminar taught by Garrett Laroy Johnson. It was taught for the first time at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Art Technology / Sound Practices department during Fall 2024 semester. The course materials are public and can be accessed here.

This repository serves as an entry point for the course's collaborative wiki project. Students will contribute (5) 500-word articles about concepts, authors,

## Installation
### GitHub
GitHub Desktop is how you will grab changes ("fetch" and "pull", in Git terminology) made by classmates and then contribute your own material ("commit" and "push" in Git terminology. This workflow is setup so that your changes will automatically be reflected on the live and public wiki website after about a 15-minute delay.

1. Students should first make a GitHub account and download the GitHub desktop client. You can do both at www.github.com.
2. Open GitHub Desktop, Go to settings and sign in.
3. Go to file > clone repository. Use click over to URL. Drop this link when prompted: `https://github.com/garrett-laroy-johnson/chaosmotic-systems-wiki`  Note the location of the cloned repository, you will use it below.

### Obsidian
Obsidian is where you will add to the Wiki on your own machine. Changes made on your own machine in Obsidian will not be automatically sync'd to the website (more on that soon).

1. Download Obsidian.
2. Open the program and click "open folder as vault". This is where you need the location of your cloned repository .../chaosmotic-systems/content.
3. Edit away! You may want to consult some tutorials on Obsidian if you need help getting started, but it is really very straight forward.

### Node.js
You will also need to download and install node.js and npm. Note the steps are different for MacOS or Windows.

#### Windows 
Windows users should be able to just download and run the installer. Follow instructions here [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en))

#### MacOS Users

You need to follow these steps as well. 

1. Open the application Terminal. 
2. Run these commands `brew install node; brew install npm`. 

If you get an error about brew, install [Homebrew]([url](https://brew.sh/)) following the instructions on this link, then try the above steps again: 

### Final Steps

1. Open your favorite application: Terminal on Mac OS or Command Prompt or Powershell on Windows. You can do this by going to Github Desktop, navigating to the 'repository' tab and selecting 'Open in Command Prompt' or 'Open in Terminal'.
2. Run the command (that means type and hit enter): npm i. This will install all the requisate files to build out the site from our Obsidian files. You are ready!

## Getting GitHub Privleges
You will not be allowed to make changes to the GitHub by default. You need to send your username to the course TA, who will manually add you as a collaborator. Do this sooner rather than later!

## Making Edits and Uploading Content
After you've completed installation successfully, you can start here every time you sit down to make changes in the future.

### Editing Workflow
Here is a workflow that will allow you to preview how the changes will appear on the public website before you commit them.

1. As a matter of habit, everytime you open Obsidian, you should also open terminal.
2. Before editing, run the command `npx quartz sync`.This will synchonize the materials on your local machine with the version on GitHub which is shared by the class.
3. When complete, run `npx quartz build --serve`.
4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080]([url](http://localhost:8080)) to see a preview of the site that reflects your local changes.

### Uploading
Note: Do not wait too long to commit and push your changes. If someone else is working on that article, you won't lose your changes, but you will need to work through the differences between them and that can be a pain. Focus on pushing commits that are complete thoughts, though not necessarily totally completed.

1. Now that we've made some changes we want to make public, return to your terminal window. Type `ctrl + c` to stop the local webserver.
6. Run `npx quartz sync`. Your changes should soon be live. You can double check that this was successful by going to the GitHub page and looking at the `content` directory. Your files should be present there.
